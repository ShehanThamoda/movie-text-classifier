LSTM-Based Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews
Overview
This project presents an LSTM-based text classifier for sentiment analysis, specifically tailored to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews. The system is trained on a dataset of 50,000 IMDb movie reviews, previously classified as either negative or positive sentiments. The dataset, conveniently stored in the 'movie_data.csv' file, serves as a robust foundation for training and evaluating the performance of the sentiment analysis model.

Key Features
LSTM Architecture: The system utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture long-range dependencies and nuances in the textual data, enabling accurate sentiment classification.

IMDb Dataset: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of 50,000 IMDb movie reviews, ensuring diversity in language, genres, and sentiments. The dataset has been pre-processed and labeled as negative or positive, providing a balanced training environment.

Sentiment Analysis: The primary goal of the project is to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in movie reviews. The trained model can be used to automatically classify the sentiment of new, unseen movie reviews.

Evaluation Metrics: The system includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the sentiment classifier, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics offer insights into the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between positive and negative sentiments.
